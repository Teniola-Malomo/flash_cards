# Language Flash Cards


## Description
Flash cards to support language learning, made using the Panda and Tkinter module.

Gives time for the users to recall the word:
  - If they **can**, click a button to move to next one
  - If they **can't** wait 3 seconds to see the word in English

If they feel comfortalbe click 
 - Press green (the tick)    
 - Otherwise press red (the cross)


## Implementation
- Used the panda libaray to read from a csv file containing the words in french and it's translation. 
- Used Tkinter to construct the GUI
- Functions to deal with turning the card, moving to the next card, hiding the card already seen (being that the person understand the word)
